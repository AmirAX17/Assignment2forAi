# Tree-Based Search Algorithms for Route Finding

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of various search algorithms for the route finding problem, developed as part of COS30019 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (Assignment 2, Part A). The goal is to find optimal paths (with lowest cost) between an origin node and one or more destination nodes on a 2D graph.

## Input File Format
Input files should follow this format:
```
Nodes:
1: (x1,y1)
2: (x2,y2)
...
Edges:
(from,to): cost
...
Origin:
start_node
Destinations:
goal_node1; goal_node2; ...
```

## Input Parser Details
The `input_parser.py` module provides a robust system for parsing test case files:

1. **File Reading**: The `read_file` function reads a file and filters out empty lines.
2. **Section Splitting**: The `split_sections` function organizes lines into sections (Nodes, Edges, Origin, Destinations).
3. **Node Parsing**: The `parse_nodes` function extracts node IDs and their (x,y) coordinates.
4. **Edge Parsing**: The `parse_edges` function processes edge definitions, creating a dictionary of connections with costs.
5. **Origin & Destination Parsing**: The `parse_origin` and `parse_destinations` functions extract start and goal nodes.
6. **Data Integration**: The `build_data` function integrates all parsing functions to return structured data.

The parser is designed to handle comments (lines starting with #) and malformed lines gracefully, ensuring robust processing of input data. Node definitions can include descriptive comments, which are preserved for human-readable output in the search results.

## Search Algorithms
The following search algorithms have been implemented:

- ✅ **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** - Uninformed: Expands all nodes at a given depth before moving to the next level
  - Implementation: Uses a queue (FIFO) to maintain frontier nodes
  - Characteristics: Complete, optimal for unweighted graphs, but can be inefficient for large graphs
  - Time Complexity: O(b^d) where b is branching factor and d is depth

- ✅ **DFS (Depth-First Search)** - Uninformed: Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
  - Implementation: Uses a stack (LIFO) to maintain frontier nodes
  - Characteristics: Not complete, not optimal, but memory-efficient
  - Time Complexity: O(b^m) where b is branching factor and m is maximum depth

- ✅ **GBFS (Greedy Best-First Search)** - Informed: Selects the node that appears closest to the goal
  - Implementation: Uses a priority queue with Euclidean distance heuristic
  - Characteristics: Not optimal, but can be efficient when heuristic is good
  - Time Complexity: O(b^m) where b is branching factor and m is maximum depth

- ✅ **A* Search** - Informed: Combines path cost and heuristic for optimal path finding
  - Implementation: Uses a priority queue with f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
  - Characteristics: Complete, optimal when heuristic is admissible
  - Time Complexity: O(b^d) where b is branching factor and d is depth of the solution
  - Memory Requirement: Higher than other algorithms

- ✅ **CUS1 (Iterative Deepening DFS)** - Uninformed: Combines benefits of BFS and DFS
  - Implementation: Uses depth-limited DFS with increasing depth limits
  - Characteristics: Complete, optimal for unweighted graphs, and memory-efficient
  - Time Complexity: O(b^d) where b is branching factor and d is depth of the solution
  - Benefits: Guarantees finding the shortest path while using minimal memory

- ✅ **CUS2 (Bidirectional Weighted A*)** - Informed: Hybrid approach combining multiple techniques
  - Implementation: Simultaneous search from both origin and destinations with dynamic weighting
  - Characteristics: Complete, near-optimal, with significantly improved efficiency
  - Time Complexity: O(b^(d/2)) where b is branching factor and d is depth of the solution
  - Key Components:
    - **Bidirectional Search**: Runs two searches simultaneously (forward from origin, backward from destinations)
    - **Dynamic Weighting**: Adjusts heuristic weight (ε) based on search progress and available memory
    - **Meeting Point Selection**: Uses sophisticated criteria to identify optimal meeting points
    - **Tie-Breaking Strategy**: Incorporates consistent tie-breaking for reproducible results
  - Benefits: Significantly faster than A* (often 10x+) while maintaining near-optimal solutions

All search algorithms are implemented to handle the following requirements:
- **Node Expansion Order**: When all else is equal, nodes are expanded in ascending order by ID
- **Chronological Order**: When nodes have equal priority, they're expanded in the order they were added
- **Path Tracking**: Each algorithm tracks the complete path from origin to goal

The implementation allows seamless switching between algorithms through the unified `search.py` interface.

## Usage
### Running a Search Algorithm
To run a search algorithm on an input file:

```bash
python search.py <filename> <method>
```

Where:
- `<filename>` is the path to the input file
- `<method>` is one of: BFS, DFS, GBFS, AS, CUS1

### Example
```bash
python search.py input_data.txt BFS
python search.py test_cases/test_case1.txt GBFS
python search.py test_cases/test_case2.txt AS
python search.py test_cases/test_case3.txt CUS1
```

### Output Format
The output follows the format specified in the assignment:
```
filename method
goal number_of_nodes
path
```

Where:
- `goal` is the goal node reached
- `number_of_nodes` is the number of nodes created during search
- `path` is the sequence of moves in the solution (e.g., `1 -> 2 -> 3`)
